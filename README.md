All projects can be built using [Nightcode](https://nightcode.info/), or on the command line using [Leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen) with the [lein-droid](https://github.com/clojure-android/lein-droid) and [lein-fruit](https://github.com/oakes/lein-fruit) plugins.

## Workflow

1. Find an issue you want to work on (that no one is assigned to)
2. Assign yourself
3. Work on the issue
4. When done working for the day, unassign yourself

Basically assignee = currently working on
