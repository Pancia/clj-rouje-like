Known Problems With Prototype:
-Crash on player death
  -The player dying in any way will cause the whole game to crash.
  -One remedy we tried was restarting the game when the player dies, but this caused a bug where the game would tick multiple
  times on one input
  -Another remedy may be to check if the player is dead more often before trying to access it's data
  -The crash occurs in the file associated with the mob type that kills us
    -Example: If a spider kills the player, there will be a crash in the spider.clj file.
-Player race and class selections not validated until game has started
  -We give the user the choice to choose their race and class and the system appears to accept any value
  -We can add more conditions to that input function to check to see their selections are valid and send a message saying they
  are invalid if that is the case.
  -This bug appears anytime you start the game and type "race incorrect-race" or "class incorrect-class"
