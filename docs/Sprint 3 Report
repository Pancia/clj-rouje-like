ACTIONS TO STOP DOING
	-Stop being late/missing team meetings
		-Team members who miss team meetings fall behind on changes made and they cannot add their feedback on ideas.
		 It is detrimental to their knowledge and to the quality of the product.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ACTIONS TO START DOING
	-Come to all planned team meetings
		-Team meetings are important times to collaborate on how to approach problems. If you miss the meeting, you
		 cannot contribute to product as efficiently as possible.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ACTIONS TO KEEP DOING
	-Getting help when you are stuck
		-Team members should reach out to each other if they are stuck to get more insight into their problems. This
		 way we can effectively work through bugs and waste less time.
	-Committing bug free code to the master branch
		-Team members have done a good job of only submitting bug free code to master so we always have a working
		 prototype of the game.
	-Use the same format in all functions and written code.
		-For components we use c-name which allows all users to easily see what is a component. Being inconsistent and
		 writing name-comp makes it more difficult to read your code.

WORK COMPLETED/NOT COMPLETED
-Completed:
	-As a developer, I want to make upgrades to the system and fix bugs [so that the game runs the way I want it to].
  -As a user, I want to use magic and spells [so that I can have a larger variety of attacks]. 
  -As a user, I want to encounter boss monsters [so that the game is more challenging]. 
  -As a user, I want to encounter merchants [so that I can sell my items and purchase items I would not be able to get 
    through other methods]. 
  -As a user, I want a save feature [so that I donâ€™t have to play the whole playthrough in one sitting]. 
  -As a developer, I'd like these traps to be finished [so that we more variety beyond arrow traps].
-Not Completed:
	None.
